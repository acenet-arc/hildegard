    comment: "The second URL is the third volume listed by Van der Linde, but his reference is not on p.468. I haven't been able to locate the poem in this volume (if you find it, please let me know!). I have, however, found a reference to the line from the poem in a couple of other sources on German song. The first URL will take you to <em>Nachträge und Korrekturen</em>, edited by Burghart Wachinger, to the page that the reference appears in an entry on Hildegard written by Michael Embach."
