    comment: "\"Stilting\" refers to Johannes Stilting who compiled and commented on documents pertaining to Hildegard's life, published in <em>Acta Sanctorum</em> Vol. 44 (Antwerp: 1755). When van der Linde says \"Stilting, no.196\" he is referring to a paragraph number in the first large section devoted to Hildegard in the <em>Acta Sanctorum</em> (pp.629-679)."
