    comment: "Van der Linde appears to have got the Rhonaeus citation directly from Ioannis, who lists the volume number etc. exactly as it is here. The original volume, however, does not have a chapter 27 in this section, and p.380 has no reference to Hildegard whatsoever. In the preceding 7 or 8 pages, there are many references to Bernard of Clairvaux, but the Hildegard passage cited by Ioannis is nowhere to be found."
