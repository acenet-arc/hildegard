    comment: "\"Stilting\" refers to Johannes Stilting who compiled and commented on documents pertaining to Hildegard's life, published in Acta Sanctorum Vol. 44 (Antwerp: 1755). When von der Linde says \"Stilting, no.351\" he is referring to a paragraph number in the first large section devoted to Hildegard in the Acta Sanctorum (pp.629-679), except that in this case he got the numbering wrong (it should read paragraph 34)."
