    comment: "\"Stilting\" refers to Johannes Stilting who compiled and commented on documents pertaining to Hildegard's life, published in <em>Acta Sanctorum</em> September, Vol.5 (Antwerp: 1755). When van der Linde says \"Stilting, no.34\" he is referring to a paragraph number in the first large section devoted to Hildegard in the <em>Acta Sanctorum</em> (pp.629-679). The URL is to the 19th-century reprint of Stilting (not of Baronius)."
