This site has been created by **Jennifer Bain**, Ph.D., Associate Professor at the Fountain School of Performing Arts at Dalhousie University with the able assistance of **Laura Harris**, and the Web Authoring Group at Dalhousie University. **James Docking** and **Julie Bock** provided many of the English translations, and **Thomas Harding** and **Zack Harrison** found many of the digitized copies of items listed in the bibliography. This project has been supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.
